According to “Justin Beegel, from Infographic World” we can set up test traps which will tell the user what they did wrong if they fell for the trap and tell them how to avoid traps in the future.

According to “Charles Koh, Pixery '' we can share real life examples of people that have been affected by phishing attacks. This will help the customer to understand the consequences of having your private information stolen on the internet, which will make the customer relate to the story and be more inclined to learn about phishing attacks and how to stop them.

According to “Bryce Welker, Crush The CPA Exam” we can send email reminders for changing emails. If we send email reminders for changing emails we can reduce and or even stop current phishing attacks because this will make it harder for the attackers to crack your password if you make it long, random, and filled with numbers, letters and symbols.

According to “”Peter Daisyme, Hostt” we can make infographics, these are good because we can put them onto social media platforms which these days everyone is using.

2FA (Two Factor Authentication) is one of the most effective measures / choices that can be taken in order to mitigate both phishing and spear phishing attacks. 2FA alone is insufficient to gain entry. Strict password management strategies can be used along with the 2FA as these together prevent the use of compromised credentials. According to “Markus Jakobsson, Agari” 2FA has become one of the most widely accepted back-up verifications for many businesses and services.

According to “Lily Hay Newman, Wired” phishing is a major threat, but awareness of the consequences it has is beneficial as there are many ways to defend yourself. Always consider the source as phishers will always make their source look like it is from a legitimate source, knowing where an email comes from is important. Make sure each password is different, as if a phisher has one of your passwords it will be harder for them to know all your passwords, alongside using 2FA. Knowing the ways to keep yourself safe online and away from hackers, is crucial in the times when technology is continuously evolving.

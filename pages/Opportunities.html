Identity theftâ€™s consequences seem very dangerous and risky, however, it comes with opportunities too. A few of these opportunities are listed below:
<br>
<br>
Once an offender is caught committing identity theft it creates chances for educating the offender. Educating the offender about the harms of identity theft, the negative impacts can change their thinking regarding committing identity theft. A study by Copes & Veterus (2009) states that identity thefts have a bounded rationality. This means that they do not take too long to think about the potential consequences of their action which further leads to opportunities to educate them.

<br>
Google maintains a blacklist of phishing sites and has built a phish filter into its Chrome browser which is one of the many new tools companies have been developing as anti-phishing tools.
<br>
<br>
There has been a boost of use of the technology in every sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meetings, classes shopping and payments online have all been boosted. This led to more opportunities for phishers to carry out attacks. This impacts victims psychologically. 
<br>
<br>
A URL based approach can be used to prevent any further increase in phishing. It uses page rank and combines it with other metrics derived on URL knowledge. Using this method can help detect up to 97% phishing websites. URL clustering, URL classification, and URL categorization mechanisms work in conjunction to give URLs a rank.
<br>
<br>
Phishing via emails: 
Problem 
<br>
The problem with emails is that the user has no dependable way to prove the validity of emails from legitimate organizations which is why they often fall victim to phishing. 
Solution
<br>
An approach that could be taken to reduce this could be that the emails sent by legitimate organizations are required to digitally sign off the email that they send so that the user is able to verify the contents of the email and reduce the chance of it to be a fake hence reducing the chance for it to be phished.

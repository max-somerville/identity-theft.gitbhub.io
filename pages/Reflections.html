                <p>The significance of the opportunities related to identity theft and phishing are very significant. Without opportunities people will not have adequate knowledge to be able to defend themselves on the internet leading to an increase in successful phishing attacks which means more stolen personal information. The risks are also extremely significant because with the risks of having so many people teaching about phishing there might be some uneducated sources teaching information that is invalid which may put peoples personal information in danger, as phishing may occur when they try to pose as an illegitimate organization teaching about phishing. The choices are also very significant because there have been no choices taken in the past this is the first time we are making a choice todo with phishing and cyber criminals taking the right first step is crucial on making the future safe for everyone surfing the web. </p>
                <h3>Monalisa Verma: 20122350</h3>
                <p>Phishing, a type of identity theft, is one of the most common forms of online crime. Phishing/Hacking is an unlawful access into a computer or an online system. As technology is the future and will continue to evolve, the risks of losing personal information will be far higher as well. Fake attachments and illegal/invalid domains pose a great risk as users increase online usage. The global pandemic of COVID-19 is a key factor in the increase of online shopping, usage of online platforms to communicate or educate online. This has led users to enter their personal details on several websites and platforms online increasing their risk of phishing. There are many ways or right actions that can be taken in order to prevent phishing and other forms of online identity theft. There should be an equal opportunity for the whole online user society to get educated about the effects of phishing and ways to keep them safe online. If online users are aware of ways their data and personal information can be stolen, they will be more cautious and therefore, will avoid the risks of data theft while using technology online. I would strongly recommend to organise frequent events, to teach people about risk factors. Ethical issues play an important role while governing the online society and there are a few ethical issues regarding identity theft. Ethical principles are the standards used to govern the effective and safe usage of online information. These ethical issues should also be addressed in the events while educating society. Phishing is a crime, let's come forward and protect our privacy/p>
                <h3>Sukhman Vir Singh: 20112113</h3>
                <p>Personally I believe that Phishing and the concept of Identity Theft in general is often disregarded as not very important by many people. I used to be one of those people, however my perspective on this changed when a friend of mine told me that someone he knew fell victim to a phishing attack and ever since then I have been more aware and secure with whom I share my personal information with. I believe that it is important for everyone to be more secure with their personal information and be aware with whom they share their personal information with as we look toward the future, we know for a fact that we will rely on technology more and more until everything about a person will be online. So if people begin and or continue to be informed about the risks that we face when dealing with phishing and identity theft and even technology as a whole then they will become more aware which will reduce the amount of successful phishing attacks and also it will help people to cope with other types of cyber attacks. Overall if people become more aware about phishing then risks of phishing will decrease and the opportunities and choices will increase and will allow them to teach themselves and others as well as the online environment will become a little bit more safer for everyone. </p>

                <p>The significance of the opportunities related to identity theft and phishing are very significant. Without opportunities people will not have adequate knowledge to be able to defend themselves on the internet leading to an increase in successful phishing attacks which means more stolen personal information. The risks are also extremely significant because with the risks of having so many people teaching about phishing there might be some uneducated sources teaching information that is invalid which may put peoples personal information in danger, as phishing may occur when they try to pose as an illegitimate organization teaching about phishing. The choices are also very significant because there have been no choices taken in the past this is the first time we are making a choice todo with phishing and cyber criminals taking the right first step is crucial on making the future safe for everyone surfing the web. </p>

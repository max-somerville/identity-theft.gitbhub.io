                <p>The significance of the opportunities related to identity theft and phishing are very significant. Without opportunities people will not have adequate knowledge to be able to defend themselves on the internet leading to an increase in successful phishing attacks which means more stolen personal information. The risks are also extremely significant because with the risks of having so many people teaching about phishing there might be some uneducated sources teaching information that is invalid which may put peoples personal information in danger, as phishing may occur when they try to pose as an illegitimate organization teaching about phishing. The choices are also very significant because there have been no choices taken in the past this is the first time we are making a choice todo with phishing and cyber criminals taking the right first step is crucial on making the future safe for everyone surfing the web. </p>
                <h3>Monalisa Verma: 20122350</h3>
                <p>Phishing, a type of identity theft, is one of the most common forms of online crime. Phishing/Hacking is an unlawful access into a computer or an online system. As technology is the future and will continue to evolve, the risks of losing personal information will be far higher as well. Fake attachments and illegal/invalid domains pose a great risk as users increase online usage. The global pandemic of COVID-19 is a key factor in the increase of online shopping, usage of online platforms to communicate or educate online. This has led users to enter their personal details on several websites and platforms online increasing their risk of phishing. There are many ways or right actions that can be taken in order to prevent phishing and other forms of online identity theft. There should be an equal opportunity for the whole online user society to get educated about the effects of phishing and ways to keep them safe online. If online users are aware of ways their data and personal information can be stolen, they will be more cautious and therefore, will avoid the risks of data theft while using technology online. I would strongly recommend to organise frequent events, to teach people about risk factors. Ethical issues play an important role while governing the online society and there are a few ethical issues regarding identity theft. Ethical principles are the standards used to govern the effective and safe usage of online information. These ethical issues should also be addressed in the events while educating society. Phishing is a crime, let's come forward and protect our privacy.</p>

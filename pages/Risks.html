Many technologies always involve risks and regardless of the ongoing attempt to decrease the chances of identity theft. Due to the several benefits against the benefits to limit identity theft to an economically efficient extent.
<br>
<br>            
Market failures are associated with identity theft in many ways. An example of this is asymmetrical information. A product that is sold to a consumer. All products come with positive and negative externalities that consumers are aware of, however there is also some information which sellers keep to themselves. Consumers are normally aware of the negative externalities of the product they are going to purchase, but sellers do not physically display this information. 
<br>
<br>                
Asymmetric information can be dangerous regarding identity theft due to the payment system. A transaction involves the purchase of a product and the sellers protection of the customer’s PII(Personally Identifiable Information). If the seller is relaxed in safeguarding information of the customer, then it’s customers are prone to the risk of identity theft. The price the customer will pay for the product should be reduced by the customer’s expected cost from misuse of their PII. Due to asymmetrical information, the seller is more aware about how it protects data than customer’s do.
<br>
<br>                 
Frequent usage of online websites, accounts and social media platforms have also been a major reason for identity theft. Utilising binary logistic regression, the relationships of an individual's online activities. The results of the British Crime Survey conducted from 2008-2009 showed that people who use the internet for banking, e-mailing and messaging are 50% more likely to fall victim to identity theft (Reynes, 2011). Comparably online shopping and downloading have led to an increase to 30%. This data shows that purchases and events in close proximity do cause identity theft; however crimes at a distance are also common and relatively easy to commit. Online identity theft is increasing at a rapid pace and will require more security to control and is likely more riskier than offline identity theft with the changing technological environment. As the global pandemic has boosted online activity like online shopping, which may lead to an increase in online identity theft.
<br>
<br> 
Another high risk related to identity theft is when the victim enters their incorrect email (with the same name as the victim). This happens unintentionally but can lead to misuse of their PII by other users online.
